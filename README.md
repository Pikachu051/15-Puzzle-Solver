# 15-Puzzle-Solver
 This is a proposal project for Problem Solving and Computer Programming (PSCP).

 This program is created to help solving the 15 Puzzle game problem using the Manhattan method.
 
# How to use
 1. Enter your problem in numbers in the following order.

     1  2  3  4

     5  6  7  8

     9  10 11 12

     13 14 15 16

    **The empty space is the zero (0)

 2. Wait for the results.
 
 3. Done

# Limitation
 With the Manhattan distance solving method, there is a limitation that the problem to solve must not be complex. We added as many conditions as we can but there are some problems that can't be solved by our program.
